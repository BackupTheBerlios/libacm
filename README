libacm - Library for InterPlay ACM Audio format.
================================================

Intro
-----

Decoder library for InterPlay ACM audio files.

Includes command line tool and plugins for Winamp, GStreamer and
XMMS family (XMMS, BMP, Audacious).

The format was used for games Fallout, Fallout 2 and Baldur's Gate series.
It is less efficient than the more advanced MP3, Vorbis or AAC algorithms,
but it's main feature is very fast decoding speed. 


NEWS
----

Version 0.9.1
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* Use autoconf/automake for build system
* Plugin for GStreamer 0.8.  (alsasink seems to be buggy for 22050 Hz
  audio.  If you hear any cracks, try to use osssink.)
* Small cleanups.

Version 0.9
~~~~~~~~~~~
* First public release.
* Includes: decoder, acmtool, plugins for XMMS, BEEP and Winamp


Installation
------------

  ./configure
  make
  make install

By default no plugins are compiled.  You must explicitly enable them:

  --enable-xmms			Enable plugin for XMMS
  --enable-beep			Enable plugin for Beep Media Player
  --enable-audacious		Enable plugin for Audacious
  --enable-gstreamer		Enable plugin for Gstreamer 0.8

By default the plugins are installed into player's main plugin directory.
To specify some other location, use following arguments:

  --with-xmms-plugindir=DIR
  --with-beep-plugindir=DIR
  --with-audacious-plugindir=DIR
  --with-gstreamer-plugindir=DIR

To compile Windows binaries (needs mingw32):

  make amp		- creates in_acm.dll
  make exe		- creates acmtool.exe


Status
------

* Decoder: stable
* WinAmp plugin: stable
* XMMS/BMP/Audacity plugin: stable
* GStreamer 0.8 plugin: beta
* GStreamer 0.9 plugin: not started
* Encoder: when I have more time


Credits
-------

All the hard work of reverse engineering the format was done
by ABel from TeamX. I simply re-implemented it in C.
